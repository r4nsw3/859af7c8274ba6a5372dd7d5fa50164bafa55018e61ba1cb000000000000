  |     Summary                                                             |

  |   Your home is under attack. The king is dead at the hands of Viking    |
  |   invaders. Hope is a distant glimmer in the fog, fading fast with      |
  |   every passing moment. As you rise to take your father's place as      |
  |   ruler, it will fall to you to stage your defenses. But make no        |
  |   mistake - this is no fight for victory, but a desperate grasp for     |
  |   survival.                                                             |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Bad North is a charming but brutal real-time tactics roguelite.       |
  |   Defend your idyllic island kingdom against a horde of Viking          |
  |   invaders, as you lead the desperate exodus of your people. Command    |
  |   your loyal subjects to take full tactical advantage of the unique     |
  |   shape of each island. Everything is at stake: fail, and watch the     |
  |   blood of your subjects stain the ground red.                          |
  |                                                                         |
  |   It's charmingly brutal, with beautiful procedurally-generated         |
  |   islands and adorable soldiers juxtaposed against the blood-stained    |
  |   realities of war. You control the broad strokes of the battle,        |
  |   giving high level commands to your soldiers who try their best to     |
  |   carry them out in the heat of the moment. It's accessibly deep,       |
  |   with simple player inputs masking a dynamic combat simulation that    |
  |   make it inviting to new players while challenging veterans.           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Keep fighting, warriors. Not for power or riches or glory, but for    |
  |   hope of peace to come once again in the harsh lands of the Bad        |
  |   North.                                                                |
